## Introduction

Darknodes are essential to Republic Protocol’s operation. They provide functionality to facilitate the order book, secure order matching engine and trade settlement.

Darknodes match orders within Republic Protocol. The requirement for running a Darknode is 100,000 REN tokens staked as collateral and a fast, stable, Internet connection. It is not computationally expensive to run a Darknode. Darknodes earn fees from the orders that they match and settle. The maximum number of Darknodes in the protocol is limited to 10,000 because of the 100,000 REN requirement. Fees can be earned in ETH and arbitrary ERC20 tokens.

## FAQ

#### What are the requirements for running a Darknode?
100,000 REN tokens for staking as collateral.
A consistent internet connection . We recommend  using a setup with similar specifications as a T2.Small on AWS or higher — If you are unfamiliar with using cloud providers, the team will step you through the entire setup process.

#### Where can I get Kovan Testnet REN from?
Koven Testnet REN will be issued by the Republic Protocol Telegram Bot when your application has been approved. For more information on this see Section 2.1: Receiving Kovan Testnet tokens. 

#### Where can I get Kovan Testnet ETH from?
If you do not have Kovan ETH, [obtain some via a public faucet](https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet).

#### How many Darknodes can there be in operation?
There can be a maximum of 10,000 Darknodes in operation.

#### How have the incentives been designed? 
The philosophy is not to design a protocol where a user is rewarded simply for being wealthy. Financial incentives within the protocol should be most accessible by those who have the network’s best interest at heart; in this case, increased liquidity within Republic Protocol.</br>

#### Can I reserve a position as a Darknode Operator on the Mainnet (when it is launched in Q3)? 
No, This is a voluntary activity and we really appreciate active operators that are helpful in identifying issues, providing feedback and maintaining the uptime of their Darknodes.

#### Do I require Mainnet REN tokens to run a Testnet Darknode?
No, In an effort to preserve privacy, we will not be requiring users to hold mainnet REN to join the testnet.

#### When will the Mainnet be launched?
The mainnet will be launched in Q3, 2018. The team is on track and your feedback will help us in achieving this.
